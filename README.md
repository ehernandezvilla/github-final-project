# Simple Interest Calculator

This calculator computes simple interest given the principal amount, the annual rate of interest, and the time period in years.

## Input Parameters

- `p`, principal amount: The initial amount of money that is being invested or loaned.
- `t`, time period in years: The duration for which the money is invested or loaned, in years.
- `r`, annual rate of interest: The yearly interest rate at which the money grows, expressed as a percentage of the principal.

## Output

The output will be the simple interest calculated using the formula:

 -  `simple interest` = `p*t*r`

## Where:
- `simple interest` is the interest amount earned or paid over the specified time period.
- `p` is the principal amount.
- `t` is the time period in years.
- `r` is the annual rate of interest (as a decimal, so 10% should be entered as 0.10).
